ARCHILLES Safe Indexer

Graceful-shutdown wrapper around indexing: the first CTRL+C finishes the
current book and stops, the second exits hard.

Backups used to live here (a full copytree of the LanceDB every 50 books,
keeping two copies). That is gone: at 1.5M chunks a copy is tens of GB, it
snapshotted a half-written database mid-run, it only ever ran from
batch_index (never from the scheduled routines, so it silently stopped
producing backups when those took over), and the copies landed on the same
drive as the database — no protection against disk loss, but a real risk of
filling the disk. Rollback now comes from LanceDB's own version retention
(see LanceDBStore.optimize_indexes), and the database is reproducible from
Calibre plus prepared_chunks anyway.
