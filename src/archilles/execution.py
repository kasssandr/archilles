"""ARCHILLES Execution Plan — *how* a recipe runs on this machine.

``plan(capabilities, recipe, mode)`` is a **pure function**: given detected
hardware (``HardwareProfile``), the hardware-independent ``IndexRecipe`` and a
mode, it derives the throughput/quality knobs that may vary per machine —
batch size, embedding device, local vs. external embedding, and reranking
on/off + reranker device. It performs no I/O and touches no real GPU, so the
whole multi-tier decision logic is unit-testable with synthetic specs (§9).

Modes (the single user-facing variable, Hardware-Tiers-V2 §7):

- ``auto`` (default): derive the sensible path from the detected class —
  capable hardware (apple-mps/gpu-mid/gpu-large) → ``full-local``; weak
  hardware (cpu-only/gpu-small) → ``light`` (flat, local, free; auto never
  silently requires external embedding or cost).
- ``light``: flat + local (degraded-compatible, zero-cost).
- ``full-local``: hierarchical (per recipe) + local embedding.
- ``full-external``: hierarchical (per recipe) + external embedding
  (prepare locally, embed elsewhere — the §8 sweet spot).

The plan's ``mode`` field holds the *resolved* mode (``auto`` is collapsed to
``light``/``full-local``). Wiring the mode from config.json/CLI and consuming
the plan is a later stage (§10.3/§10.4).

See docs/internal/CONCEPT_2026-06-23_HARDWARE_TIERS_V2.md (§3, §4, §6, §9).
